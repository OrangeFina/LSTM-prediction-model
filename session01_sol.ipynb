    "\n",
    "Our working definition of a **function** has been that it is a tool that can perform certain operations. Now, we will learn more about using functions that other people have created, and writing our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can do two things with functions: **call** them, and **define** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a function is often referred to as **calling** the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function:\n",
    "- *MUST* perform some action.\n",
    "- *CAN* have one or more inputs, that it will use while performing the action.\n",
    "- *CAN* have one or more outputs, that is the result of performing the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look more closely at some functions we've already covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print`\n",
    "    - Action: Prints some data on the screen.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The data to be printed\n",
    "    - Outputs: None\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `input`\n",
    "    - Action: Prints a prompt to the screen, and accepts some textual input from the user.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The prompt text (string)\n",
    "    - Outputs: The user's input (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `<List>.insert`\n",
    "    - Action: Inserts an element into a list at the given index position.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The index position and the element to insert\n",
    "    - Outputs: None\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the inputs are called **parameters** or **arguments**. The outputs are called **return values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions accept multiple data types for their arguments, while others don't. Always check the documentation for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the functions that do return a value, we can capture their output by assigning it to a variable. That is what we've been doing with our `input` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "user_name = input(\"What is your name?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    def <FUNCTION NAME>(<PARAM1>, <PARAM2>...):\n",
    "        <DO SOMETHING>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return <RETURN VALUE>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay careful attention to the location of the parentheses, commas, colon, and indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line is optional. A function will stop operating when it reaches a `return` command. If the `return` command is not followed by a value, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even if you define a function, nothing will happen unless you call it!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the following:\n",
    "- Does the order of the parameters matter?\n",
    "- Does it matter what you name the function? What are the rules and conventions for naming functions?\n",
    "- Does it matter what you name the parameters?\n",
    "- What happens if you only give the third function a value for `name` but not `age`?"
